Okay, here's a revised version of the excerpt, focusing on enhanced flow, sharper imagery, and a more compelling narrative voice:

**"The Gates of Morning" - Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder**

Dick stood on a coral ledge, facing south. Behind him, the ocean's untamed power hammered the outer reef, sending plumes of spray skyward. Before him, the lagoon of Karolin unfurled – a vast, serene lake mirroring the boundless sky. Gulls wheeled and cried above the azure expanse. *His* expanse. He had arrived only yesterday.

He watched the villagers scattered along the beach: women, children, youths – all bustling with nets and fishing lines. They worked, laughed, and lived under the brilliant sun. *His* people now. The canoes hauled onto the sand, the empty houses that once sheltered war canoes – all now his responsibility.

A shadow fell across his face. He shifted his gaze from the lagoon's tranquil surface to the silent canoe houses. Turning his back on the placid water, he confronted the roaring breakers and the northern sea. Far beyond the horizon, invisible, lay Palm Tree Island. A dream of beauty, they called it. A nest of devils, he knew.

A small voice broke through his reverie. Little Tari, son of the net maker, Le Taioi, sat on the coral beside him, gazing up with wide island eyes. Tari knew little of the world, but he knew that war had stolen Karolin's men, leaving the women, boys, and children vulnerable, leaderless.

Then, yesterday, from the northern sea, a strange boat had appeared, bearing Katafa. They brought this man, this Taori. *Sent by the gods*, the women whispered, to be their chief, their protector.

The child knew nothing of gods, nor did he care. Alone with this intriguing stranger, beyond his mother’s hearing, he asked with a child's directness: “Taori,” he said, “Who are you?” (é kamina tai)

Could Dick have truly answered? Would Tari have understood?

*Tari, I'm not from here. My name is Dick Lestrange, and when I was your age, I was stranded on Marua – what you call Palm Tree – with an old sailor named Kearney. We lived there until Katafa, who'd been lost at sea from here, found us. She taught me your language and called me Taori. We fell in love and might have stayed on Marua forever, but a ship arrived, filled with ruthless men from the eastern islands. They burned the ship, murdered the white men aboard. Katafa and I escaped in Kearney’s boat, carrying what little we could, guided by the lagoon’s reflection in the night sky.*

But he couldn't tell Tari all of that. Not the whole truth. The name "Dick" had faded, along with the language of his youth. Kearney, his guardian, had become a hazy memory, lost in the tropical sun. The past was a blurred dream. His *real* life began with Katafa, not before. Only Kearney’s little toy ships, the ones he had made Dick as a boy, remained.

He looked down at the curious child. "I am Taori," he said, "Taori tatu. Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," said the child. "I only ask as I breathe. But the big folk – madyana – never answer the questions of Tari. Ai, the fish!" His attention already shifting, drawn by the cries of children hauling in a net, he scrambled up and ran off.

Dick turned back to the north. The child's simple question had stirred something deep. He saw again the schooner anchored off Palm Tree, ablaze. He saw Katafa and himself fleeing in that old dinghy, the one Kearney had taught him to sail. He relived their arrival on this beach, the welcoming faces of the women and children, hailing him as a savior, a leader.

As he looked north, the memory of the men he had fled stained the beauty of the sea and sky.

There was no immediate threat from the men who held Palm Tree. They had no canoes – *yet*. But they would build them, surely. And as surely as the sun rose, they would see the lagoon’s shimmering reflection in the distance. It might take time, but they *would* come.

Dick was becoming a kanaka, a man of the islands. But the white man's mind remained, allowing him to think ahead, to anticipate.

That's why he had sent a canoe that morning to the southern beach, to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata – three old men, too old for war, but masters of canoe building. That's why he had noticed the nearly hundred youths ripening to war age. But beneath it all lay his fierce love for Katafa.

War canoes! Would he defend the lagoon? Or would he strike first, annihilating the threat before it could take root? He didn't know.

A hand fell on his shoulder. Turning, he found himself face to face with Katafa. A strand of her dark hair had escaped the vine holding it, blowing back on the breeze like a dark feather. Her luminous eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the horizon to the north.

"Look," said Katafa.

Under the right conditions, Palm Tree would appear from Karolin through a mirage. Last evening they had seen it, and now it was rising again, a mysterious smudge low on the horizon, a faint spot in the sea’s dazzle that deepened and hardened until the island materialized, beautiful as a dream, diaphanous, yet vivid.

Hand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, their minds unburdened by science. They knew nothing of mirages. Their eyes were fixed on the place from which they had escaped, now rising so strangely beyond the sea as if to gaze at them.

They saw again the horde of savages on the beach, monstrous figures from a nightmare. They felt again the wind that filled the sail as the dinghy raced for safety, the open sea, and heard the yells of the Melanesians, crazed with rum stolen from the burned schooner. There, before them, lay the scene of the tragedy, a lovely picture that revealed nothing of the demons that still inhabited it.

As Dick gazed at the haunting scene, his nostrils flared, and his eyes darkened with hate. That they had threatened *him* was nothing. But that they had threatened Katafa – that was everything. And the threat remained.

Some day, they *would* come. The mirage of Palm Tree was a warning. They would build canoes, and seeing the lagoon's shimmering light, they would come. They had no women, those men, and here there were women. Instinct whispered that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon for an island to raid for its women, and seeing the lagoon light, they would come.

Ah, if he had known, danger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred roamed on that azure sea. Not only among savages, but from the wolves of civilization.

To Dick, there was no world beyond the water that ringed those two islands. No Europe, no America, no history but the history of his short life and the life of Katafa. And yet, even in that life, he had learned to dread men and to envisage the foundation of all history: man’s instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.

Then, gradually, the mirage of Palm Tree began to fade, vanishing like a snuffed candle. As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed across the water to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.

It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they walked down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.

**Key Changes and Explanations:**

*   **Stronger Opening:** Emphasized the power of the sea and Dick's ownership/responsibility.
*   **Sharper Imagery:** Replaced weaker adjectives with more vivid ones (e.g., "raw power" became "untamed power").  Added imagery (e.g., "plumes of spray skyward").
*   **Internal Monologue:** Made Dick's thoughts more immediate and accessible using italics.
*   **Conciseness:** Removed redundant phrases and words.
*   **Pacing and Rhythm:** Broke up long sentences for better flow. Used shorter sentences for emphasis.
*   **Word Choice:**  Swapped out outdated/stilted language for more modern and impactful choices. For example, "savages" became "ruthless men" in one instance and then became "a man of the island" at another.
*   **Emphasis:** Used italics strategically to highlight key words and phrases.
*   **Sentence Structure:** Varied sentence structure to keep the reader engaged.
*   **Show, Don't Tell:** Expanded on the character's emotions and thoughts, allowing them to be more fully felt.

This version aims to be more engaging, evocative, and accessible to a contemporary reader while preserving the core narrative and themes.
