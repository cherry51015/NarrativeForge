Here's a revised version of the excerpt, aiming for clarity, engagement, and a more modern feel:

**"The Gates of Morning" - Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder**

Dick stood on a coral ledge, gazing south. Behind him, the ocean's raw power crashed against the outer reef, sending spray flying. Ahead, the lagoon of Karolin stretched calm and endless, a sea-sized lake mirroring the sky. Gulls wheeled and cried above the azure expanse. This was his. Only yesterday, he had arrived.

He looked out over the people now spread along the beach busy with nets and fishing. Women, children, youths, all worked, laughed, and lived under the brilliant sun. They were his people now. The canoes pulled up on the sand, the empty houses that once sheltered war canoes – all his responsibility.

A shadow crossed his face as he shifted his gaze from the lagoon to the empty canoe houses. Turning his back to the tranquil water, he faced the roaring breakers and the northern sea. Far beyond the horizon, invisible, lay Palm Tree Island. A dream of beauty, they said. A nest of devils, he knew.

A small voice broke his reverie. Little Tari, son of the net maker, Le Taioi, sat on the coral nearby, looking up at him with those big island eyes. Tari knew little of the world, but he knew that war had stolen all the men of Karolin, leaving the women, boys, and children defenseless, leaderless.

Then, yesterday, out of the northern sea, had come a strange boat and Katafa. They brought this man, this Taori. Sent by the gods, the women whispered, to be their chief, their protector.

The child knew nothing of gods, nor did he care. Alone with this new wonder, beyond his mother’s hearing, he asked the direct, simple question of a child: “Taori,” he said, “Who are you?” (é kamina tai)

Could Dick have answered fully, would Tari have understood?

*"Tari, I am not from here. My name is Dick Lestrange, and when I was your size, I was stranded on Marua – what you call Palm Tree – with an old sailor named Kearney. We lived there until Katafa, once lost at sea from here, came to us. She taught me your language and called me Taori. We loved each other, and we might have stayed on Marua forever if a ship hadn't arrived, filled with bad men from the eastern islands. They burned the ship and killed the white men with them. So Katafa and I escaped in Kearney’s boat, taking with us what little we had, guided by the reflection of the lagoon in the night sky."*

But he couldn't tell Tari all of that. Not the whole truth. The name "Dick" had faded from his memory, along with the language of his childhood. Kearney, his guardian, had become a hazy memory, almost lost in the blinding light of the tropics. The past was a blurred and distant dream. It started with Katafa, not before. Kearney lived on through the little ships he had made Dick as a boy.

He looked down at the questioning child. "I am Taori," he said, "Taori tatu. Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," said the child, "I only ask as I breath. But the big folk – madyana – never answer the questions of Tari. Ai, the fish!" His quick mind already darted elsewhere, drawn by the cries of children hauling in a net. He scrambled up and ran off.

Dick turned his gaze back to the north. The child's question had stirred something deep within him. He saw again the schooner anchored off Palm Tree, consumed by flames. He saw Katafa and himself escaping in that old dinghy, the one Kearney had taught him to sail. He relived their arrival on this beach, the faces of the women and children swarming around him, hailing him as a godsend, a leader.

As he looked north, the memory of the men he had fled stained the beauty of the sea and sky.

There was no immediate danger from the men who had seized Palm Tree. They had no canoes – yet. But they would build them, surely they would build canoes, and as surely as the sun rose, they would see the far-off mirror blaze of Karolin's lagoon in the sky. It might take a long time, but they would come.

Dick was almost a kanaka, a savage. Still, the white man's mind was there. He could think ahead, anticipate.

That was why he had sent a canoe that morning to the southern beach, to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata – three old men, too old for war, but masters of canoe building. That was why he had noticed how nearly a hundred youths were ripening to war age. But under all lay his fierce love for Katafa.

War canoes! Would he defend the lagoon? Or would he strike first, destroying the threat before it could take root? Who knew?

A hand fell on his shoulder. Turning, he found himself face to face with Katafa. A strand of her dark hair had escaped from the vine that held it, blowing back on the breeze like a dark feather. Her luminous eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed where he had been looking: due north, at the sea line.

"Look," said Katafa.

Under the right conditions, Palm Tree would appear from Karolin through a mirage. Last evening they had seen it and now it was rising again, a mysterious stain low on the horizon, a faint spot in the sea’s dazzle that deepened, hardened, until the island materialized, beautiful as a dream, diaphanous, yet vivid.

Hand on his shoulder, they stood without speaking, their minds unburdened by science. They knew nothing of mirage. Their eyes were fixed on the place from which they had escaped, now rising so strangely beyond the sea as if to gaze at them.

They saw again the horde of savages on the beach, monstrous figures from a nightmare. They felt again the wind that filled the sail as the dinghy raced for safety, the open sea, and again they heard the yells of the Melanesians, crazed with rum stolen from the burned schooner. There, before them, lay the scene of the tragedy, a lovely picture that revealed nothing of the demons that still inhabited it.

As Dick gazed at the haunting scene, his nostrils flared, and his eyes darkened with hate. That they had threatened him was nothing. But that they had threatened Katafa – that was everything. And the threat remained.

Some day they would come. The mirage of Palm Tree was a warning. They would build canoes, and seeing the lagoon's mirror-light, they would come. They had no women, those men, and here there were women. Instinct whispered to him that as he had been drawn to Katafa, so would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon for some island to be raided for its women, and seeing the lagoon light, they would come.

Ah, if he had known, danger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred roamed on that azure sea, not only among savages, but from the wolves of civilization.

To Dick, there was no world beyond the water that ringed those two islands. No Europe, no America, no history but the history of his short life and the life of Katafa. And yet, even in that life, he had learned to dread men and to envisage the foundation of all history: man’s instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.

Then, gradually, the mirage of Palm Tree began to fade and pass, vanished like a light blown out, and as they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed across the water to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.

It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they walked down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.
